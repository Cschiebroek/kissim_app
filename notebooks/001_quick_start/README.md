## `001_quick_start_kissim.ipynb`

### Loading `kissim` results

This is a short notebook showing how to load the `kissim` output files as Python objects.

- `fingerprint.json`: Fingerprints for all successfully encoded structures
- `fingerprint_clean.json`: Fingerprints dataset without outlier structures
- `feature_distances.csv.bz2`: Feature distances between all fingerprint pairs
- `fingerprint_distances.csv.bz2`: Fingerprint distances between all fingerprint pairs


## `002_quick_start_datasets.ipynb`

### Quick start on how to access different datasets

This notebook demonstrates how to use the `src.data` module to quickly and easily load different datasets on ligands, kinases, profiling, distances and target datasets.
