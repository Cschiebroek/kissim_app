## `001_kinome_tree_versions.ipynb`

### `kissim`-based kinome tree

We generate `kissim`-based kinome matrices and trees based on three different parameters:

- `kissim` runs: With/without charged-THR bug, different KLIFS datasets
- Feature weighting schemes
- DFG conformations
  - Kinase matrix based on all structures/fingerprints (**DFG-in and DFG-out**)
  - Kinase matrix based on structure/fingerprints in **DFG-in** conformation only
  - Kinase matrix based on structure/fingerprints in **DFG-out** conformation only
- Clustering methods
