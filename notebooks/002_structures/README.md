### AlphaFold DB kinase dataset

So `kissim` can only reach the structurally covered kinome? Well, we are in luck! 

Let's use the predicted kinase structures provided in the AlphaFold DB (AF) and use these structures to generate a AF-based `kissim` tree.

In this notebook we prepare a kinase subset of the AF human dataset.
