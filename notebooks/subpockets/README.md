## `subpocket_robustness.ipynb`

### Subpocket center robustness

We aim for robust subpocket centers, in order to calculate comparable subpocket distances across kinase structures.

- Mean/standard deviation for centers between and across subpockets
- Superimpose random structures with their subpocket centers
