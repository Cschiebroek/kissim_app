## `001_anchor_residue_selection.ipynb`

Anchor residue selection

We explore different anchor residue definitions to calculate subpocket centers (includes comparison to [KinFragLib](https://github.com/volkamerlab/kinfraglib)).


## `002_subpocket_robustness.ipynb`

Subpocket center robustness

We aim for robust subpocket centers, in order to calculate comparable subpocket distances across kinase structures.

- Mean/standard deviation for centers between and across subpockets
- Superimpose random structures with their subpocket centers


## `003_subpocket_vs_conformations.ipynb`

Influence of conformations on subpockets

We explore (visually) the influence of DFG/aC-helix conformations on the `kissim` subpocket centers.


## `004_subpocket_to_target_residues.ipynb`

Subpockets to target residue(s)

We explore the distance of the `kissim` subpocket centers to their target residues.
