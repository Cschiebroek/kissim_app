### Loading `kissim` results

This is a short notebook showing how to load the `kissim` output files as Python objects.

- `fingerprint.json`: Fingerprints for all successfully encoded structures
- `fingerprint_clean.json`: Fingerprints dataset without outlier structures
- `feature_distances.csv`: Feature distances between all fingerprint pairs
- `fingerprint_distances.csv`: Fingerprint distances between all fingerprint pairs
